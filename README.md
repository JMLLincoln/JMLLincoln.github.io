Really, this Readme file is a notepad for me; you can read it if you want but it won't be the slightest bit life changing.

---

## Present
1. index.html  
	+ currently being used as a placeholder to link to the JavaScript Junk page where my HTML/CSS/JS games are stored.

2. jsjunk.html 
	+ pretty dull but links to all the JavaScript projects I've done recently  

---

## Future
1. index.html 
	+ to become a portfolio containing my CV.  
	+ probably add other pages containig my main projects  

2. jsjunk.html  
	+ make it look nice
	+ add separate form.css / overlay.css file which can be used throughout the games; changing a single file would be much easier
	+ on that note, maybe just add a basic css file for every game to have with simple formatting, any advanced formatting can be done in page specific css files

3. CV
	+ add a page for the cv, 
	+ or just link to a pdf, 
	+ or maybe both, whichever

4. Different Screens and Devices
	+ add css to support different devices 
	+ attempt to get a polished looking website on various screen sizes
	+ possibly add ios and android support for the games as well
