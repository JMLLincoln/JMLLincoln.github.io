Really, this Readme file is a notepad for me; you can read it if you want but it won't be the slightest bit life changing.
 
## Present
+ index.html is currently being used as a placeholder to link to the JavaScript Junk page where my HTML/CSS/JS games are stored.
 
+ jsjunk.html is pretty dull but links to all the JavaScript projects I've done recently
 
## Future
+ index.html is to become a portfolio containing my CV.
+ probably add other pages containig my main projects
 
+ jsjunk.html should actually look nice
+ add separate form.css / overlay.css file which can be used throughout the games; changing a single file would be much easier
+ on that note, maybe just add a basic css file for every game to have with simple formatting, any advanced formatting can be done in page specific css files

+ add a page for the cv, or just link to a pdf, or maybe both, whichever
