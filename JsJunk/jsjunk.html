				<h1 class="title"> JavaScript Junk </h1>
				<p class="subText"> 
					The first game 'I' programmed in JavaScript was snake. 
					I saw a 'snake in 4 minutes 30 seconds' video which I attempted 
					to copy from memory. 
					<br>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs">
						Here's a link to the video.
					</a>
					<br>
					<br>
					This inspired me to make my own games using only HTML/CSS 
					and JavaScript and this is what I came up with:
				</p>
				<div class="smallBox">
					<li class="gameEntry">
						<h2> Snake </h2>
						<p class="gameText"> 
							'Up Down Left Right' / 'WASD' to control the snake. 
							Eat the monotone apples to score points and increase 
							your size. Don't eat yourself idiot.
						</p>
						<a class="gameButton" href="snake/play.html">
							<p class="gameButtonText">Play!</p>
						</a>
						<img class="gameImage" src="images/snake.png" alt="Game Image">
					</li>
					<li class="gameEntry">
						<h2> Falling Down </h2>
						<p class="gameText">
							The roof is lava okay. Don't touch it or you'll d.
							Try to stay as close to the bottom as possible to 
							survive and rack up them dere points. 'Left Right'
							/ 'A D'to move.
						</p>
						<a class="gameButton" href="fallingdown/play.html">
							<p class="gameButtonText">Play!</p>
						</a>
						<img class="gameImage" src="images/fallingdown.png" alt="Game Image">
					</li>
					<li class="gameEntry">
						<h2> Memory Card Game </h2>
						<p class="gameText">
							Select two cards and try to get a match. If you're not
							successful, memorise the card positions as best you can.
							Collect more cards in total than your opponent.
						</p>
						<a class="gameButton" href="memory/play.html">
							<p class="gameButtonText">Play!</p>
						</a>
						<img class="gameImage" src="images/memorygame.png" alt="Game Image">
					</li>
					<li class="gameEntry">
						<h2> Sand Piles </h2>
						<p class="gameText">
							The idea is pretty straightforward: place sand in a cell and 
							if there are four or more, they topple and spread to 
							the neighbouring cells. 
						</p>
						<a class="gameButton" href="sandpiles/play.html">
							<p class="gameButtonText">Play!</p>
						</a>
						<img class="gameImage" src="images/sandpiles.png" alt="Game Image">
					</li>
					<li class="gameEntry">
						<h2> Shooter </h2>
						<p class="gameText">
							'Up Down Left Right' / 'WASD' to control the block.
							Shoots towards the cursor.
							Touching the hollow blocks will hurt you.
							Gain points for surving and shooting hollows.
						</p>
						<a class="gameButton" href="shooter/play.html">
							<p class="gameButtonText">Play!</p>
						</a>
						<img class="gameImage" src="images/shooter.png" alt="Game Image">
					</li>
					<li class="gameEntry">
						<h2> Breakout </h2>
						<p class="gameText">
							The aim is to break as many block as possible by bouncing
							the white block towards the coloured blocks. 'Left Right' /
							'A D' to move. You're vertically disabled so don't drop it.
						</p>
						<a class="gameButton" href="breakout/play.html">
							<p class="gameButtonText">Play!</p>
						</a>
						<img class="gameImage" src="images/breakout.png" alt="Game Image">
					</li>
					<li class="gameEntry">
						<h2> Battle Shooters </h2>
						<p class="gameText">
							Same controls as 'Shooter'. Added 'rooms' to act as levels.
							Each level is completed when all enemies are defeated then
							doors open up to the next level. 
						</p>
						<a class="gameButton" href="breakout/play.html">
							<p class="gameButtonText">Play!</p>
						</a>
